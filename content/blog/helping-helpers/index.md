Why Helping helpers is more effective than trying to help an individual in-need. 

When we help someone or a group of individuals, although the help is good, it may reach those only. And if the same help is provided to an individual or a organization, they can do much more.

## A few
- It's easy to talk to someone who is aready doing kind work.
- Individuals or Organizations have reach to more people/regions/countries. And example can be helping [RedCross](https://www.redcross.org/) will help them to do more. They work in lots of regions/countries otherwise we cannot reach.

## Kind of help NonProits will look for:
1. Technology Assistance
2. Fundrasing
3. Marketing
4. Professional Services
5. Help with Management
