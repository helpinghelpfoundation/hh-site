Why Helping helpers is more effective than trying to help an individual in-need. 

Why this foundation?
We believe this strongly. Everyday we come across many random acts of kindness. Some are so small that we forget and some are significant. But small or big, people around try to help each other in one way or other. This really inspires and motivates us.

There are some individuals who try to help others even they do not have a lot of fame, support, or an organization.. they just do it for the sake of humanity and to feel content. They do not expect donations, popularity in media and are so humble in what they do.

We wanted to HELP these self-motivated individuals in a way we can. Give them some coverage, let other people know that to HELP others, all we need is a HEART to HELP!

What we do for a living?
We are software developers; Have our day jobs; Live modestly in Texas, USA; Always an eye for those inspiring individuals.. we call them OUR HEROES!!!
